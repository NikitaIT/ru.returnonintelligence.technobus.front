# Bus schedule Technopolis

The project was developed as part of the training practice at the [Emergn / Return on Intelligence](https://www.linkedin.com/company/emergn/) and available on [link](https://nikitait.github.io/dist/).

The starting template [OptimizedHTML](https://github.com/NikitaIT/optimizedhtml-start-template) was taken as a basis. Added ES6 support with [babel](https://babeljs.io/) and jsdoc3.

- As a driver, I can fill in the schedule in a **Google spreadsheet**.
- The schedule is synchronized on the website and in the mobile application.
- The movement of the bus can be seen on the **map**.
- This is an **offline first** site and mobile application. Works even without internet connection.
